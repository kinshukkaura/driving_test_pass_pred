# Problem Description
XYZ has been learning driving for some time, and is thinking of taking the practical car
test in UK.1. There are two sensible options for XYZ:
1. either take the practical test at the nearest test centre to his/her home;
2. or take it at the nearest test centre to the LSE.
Note that in XYZ's generated prole, the entry \Home address" actually gives the
name of the nearest test driving test centre to XYZ's home. In addition, the test centre
closest to the LSE is Wood Green (London).2
XYZ thinks his/her driving skill is about average. It is widely believed that the driving
test routes around some centres are probably more dicult than others (e.g. there are far
less bus lanes, roundabouts and cyclists in rural areas than in London).
XYZ knows that you (who is his/her best friend) are taking ST447 this term. XYZ
wants to rely on your data analysis skills, and would like you to answer the following
questions:
1. What is XYZ's expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to his/her home?
2. What is XYZ's expected passing rate at the nearest test centre to the LSE?
3. Of these two locations, where should XYZ take the test? Is there any evidence to
(statistically) support this suggestion?
